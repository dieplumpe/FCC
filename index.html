        <h2>A remarkable biography of this prominent scientist:</h2>
        <ul>
       <li><strong>January 25, 1900</strong> - Dobzhansky was born in Nemyriv, Russian Empire, currently Ukraine, an only child.</li>
       <li><strong>At high school</strong> - Dobzhansky collected butterflies and decided to become a biologist.</li>
       <li><strong>1917-1921</strong> - Dobzhansky attended the Kiev State University, where he then studied until 1924 specializing in entomology.</li>
       <li><strong>1924</strong> - He moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where a Drosophila melanogaster lab had been established.</li>
       <li><strong>1927</strong> - Dobzhansky immigrated to the United States on a scholarship from the International Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation to work and study in the United States. Upon arriving in New York City, he joined the Drosophila Group at Columbia University. Their work provided crucial information on Drosophila cytogenetics.</li>
       <li><strong>1930-194</strong> - He worked to the California Institute of Technology. On the basis of his experiments, he articulated the idea that reproductive isolation can be caused by differences in presence of microbial symbionts between populations.</li>
       <li><strong>1937</strong> - Dobzhansky published one of the major works of the modern evolutionary synthesis, the synthesis of evolutionary biology with genetics, titled Genetics and the Origin of Species, which amongst other things, defined evolution as "a change in the frequency of an allele within a gene pool". Dobzhansky's work was instrumental in spreading the idea that it is through mutations in genes that natural selection takes place.</li>
       <li><strong>1940-1962</strong> - He returned to Columbia University. </li>
       <li><strong>1941</strong> - Dobzhansky was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.</li>
       <li><strong>1941</strong> - He was elected president of the Genetics Society of America.</li>
       <li><strong>1943</strong> - The University of Sao Paulo awarded him an honorary doctorate.</li>
       <li><strong>1950</strong> - Dobzhansky was elected  president of the American Society of Naturalists.</li>
       <li><strong>1950</strong> - He was one of the signatories of the UNESCO statement The Race Question. He then moved to the Rockefeller Institute (shortly to become Rockefeller University).</li> 
       <li><strong>1951</strong> - He was elected president of the Society for the Study of Evolution.</li>
       <li><strong>1963</strong> - Dobzhansky was elected  president of the American Society of Zoologists.</li> 
       <li><strong>1964</strong> - He was a member of the Board of Directors of the American Eugenics Society.</li> 
       <li><strong>1968</strong> - Dobzhansky had been diagnosed with lymphocytic leukemia (a chronic form of leukemia), and had been given a few months to a few years to live.</li>
       <li><strong>1969</strong> - He was elected president of the American Teilhard de Chardin Association.</li> 
       <li><strong>1971</strong> - Dobzhansky retired from the Rockefeller University moving to the University of California, Davis where he continued working as an emeritus professor. He published one of his most famous essays "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution" at this time, influenced by the paleontologist and priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.</li>
       <li><strong>1972</strong> - He was elected the first president of the BGA (Behavior Genetics Association), and was recognized by the society for his role in behavior genetics, and the founding of the society by the creation of the Dobzhansky Award (for a lifetime of outstanding scholarship in behavior genetics).</li>
       <li><strong>1975</strong> - His leukemia had become more severe, and on November 11 he traveled to San Jacinto, California for treatment and care. Working till his last day as a Professor of Genetics, Dobzhansky died (from heart failure) on December 18, 1975 in Davis, California.</li>
